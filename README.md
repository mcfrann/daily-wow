## Overview

Need an extra little dose of positivity to get you through your day? Introducing Daily Wow, an application that randomly chooses a moment Owen Wilson has said 'wow' to give you a little encouragement. Have a certain 'wow' in mind? Use the search bar to search for 'wow's by movie title. Make sure to click on Owen to see him say 'wow' to you, himself!

## Project Goals

The goal of this project was to sharpen my React skills while implementing the v6 Router, asynchronous JavaScript, REST API, mobile-friendly design, and Cypress testing. I also wanted to take full advantage of the creative liberty of this project and trigger a self-made animation of Owen Wilson saying today's random 'wow.' Daily Wow showcases my ability to create a simple, yet creative React application.
